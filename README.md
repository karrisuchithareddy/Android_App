# Android_App

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
As part of my minor internship, I have worked on Android Studio and developed a project using Java and Flutter by using Dart.

I have done minor internship from verzeo on Android App Development. Throughout this internship, I have gained a good knowledge on usage of Dart along with the Flutter. I have understood the basics of setting up the apps based on Android, ios, PC. By the end of this internship, I have known with themes in Flutter such as navigating to new routes, send data from one screen to another screen in Android Studio and also how to develop the applications.

Also, any changes or modifications and additional requirements are welcomed, if you prefer to work with this project.
