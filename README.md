# Android_App

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
As part of my minor internship, I have worked on Android Studio and developed a project using Java and Flutter by using Dart.

Through this internship, I have gained a good knowledge on usage of Android Studio and how to develop the applications.

Also, any changes or modifications and additional requirements are welcomed, if you prefer to work with this project.
